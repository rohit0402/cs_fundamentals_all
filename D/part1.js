// DBMS( data base management system) 

// # Data->collection of raw bytes like integers ,images 
//     -> measured by bytes or bits don't have meaning unless processed, data is the new oil

// # types of data-> (Quantative)-> numerical,weighted form, (Qualitative)-> like name gender,color age

// # information-> when data is organized,structure,processedand give some meaning, helps analyzing and interpreting
//     like product feedback ->data when analyzing feedback for better customer exprience beomes information

// # DATABASE ->a collection of data or a place in device where data kept so that easily accesible, managable,updating 
//     -> and to use this operation data base management system require

// # DBMS ->collection of interrelated data and set of program to access that data
//     ->its primary goal to store and retreive database information in both convenient and efficient way

// *** DBMS VS FILe SYSTEM , file system disadvantages ,advantages of dbms ,why to use dbms***
// -> data redundancy and incosistency -> leads to duplicate data in some file with other file
// -> difficulty in  accesing data
// -> data isolation -> not easily accesible and make operation on data
// ->integrity problems -> suppose a cutomer have 2 account in same bank one savings account and one current account if address changes
//     then diffult to change once at all
// ->atomicity problems-> gurantees that either all operation apply on data successfully or none of them applied
// ->concurrent-access anomalies ->when multiple operations applied on same data leading to unexpected results
// ->security problems ->like logistic department get access to only customer address and customer service gets access to customer previous order too
